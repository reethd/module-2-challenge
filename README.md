# module-2-challenge

#### This web developer portfolio contains an avatar as well as the developer's name as a header, followed by a nav bar that will take the user to one of 3 different sections: An about me blurb, a portfolio gallery, and a contact bar. The portfolio section showcases the first website created by the developer, followed by a list of following acheivments (currently represented by placeholders), which can be easily added to. This webpage also reactively scales to smaller viewing screens if needed.
